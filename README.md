***Testing the fundamentals of Python and Flask***

**How to run the app?**

```$ export FLASK_APP=app.py```

```$ flask run```

**What is ```dictionary_alpha_arrays.json```?**

- See here: https://github.com/matthewreagan/WebstersEnglishDictionary

**Specifications**

The Python code is in ```app.py``` and the HTML for the webpage is in ```index.html```. These are the two files which you will have to modify.

Use ```dictionary_alpha_arrays.json``` to make an app where the user can input any letter in the alphabet and receive a table of words that start with that later and their corresponding definitions. Figure out how ```dictionary_alpha_arrays.json``` is structured and how you can extract its information in order to return the correct information. 

It will help you to use print statements in your code to view output in the terminal (for debugging purposes). Remember how you send information between ```app.py``` and ```index.html```. If you need hints, look back at the Spotipy example: https://github.com/eelegiap/spotipy-example
